# Markowitz-Modern-Portfolio-Theory---Summary-Insights-and-Python-Implementation

The Modern Portfolio, as propounded by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is a fundamental theory that helps in finding the optimal allocation of assets in a portfolio. In this article, we provide a concise look at the theory and then implement the theory in Python. We use two asset and three asset cases to explain how we find the equilibrium allocation.

## Overview
This project explores the Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), providing practical insights into portfolio optimization using Python. The notebook includes:
- Monte Carlo simulations to generate assets.
- Analysis of portfolio risk and return.
- Construction of optimal portfolios (with and without shorting).
- Efficient frontier visualization.

## Key Features
- Python-based implementations of mean-variance optimization.
- Visualization of the feasible set, efficient frontier, and tangent portfolio.
- Practical insights into portfolio construction strategies.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the codes from line 1 to the last line.
